In the case of HIP, every time a HIP-enabled MN changes address, it notifies the CN through a sequence of three UPDATE messages.

1) Upon obtaining a new IP address, the MN sends a LOCATOR parameter to the CN in an UPDATE message containing the new IP address, the values of the old and new SPIs
 for a security association. The mobile host waits for this UPDATE to be acknowledged, and retransmits if necessary.

2) The CN receives the UPDATE, validates it, and updates any local bindings between the HIP association and the MN's destination address. The CN MUST perform an address
   verification. This is done by sending an ECHO_REQUEST(pigggybacking UPDATE ACK) to the MN at its new address.

3) The MN completes the readdress by processing the UPDATE ACK and echoing the ECHO_RESPONSE.  Once the CN receives this ECHO_RESPONSE, it considers the new address to
   be verified and can put the address into full use.
  
Thus, we define the HIP handover latency as the time elapsed from the moment when the MN disassociates from the old access point and until the MN sends out the third
UPDATE packet while connected to the new access point [3]. The latency consists of the following delay components: L2 handover, router discovery, duplicate address detection, and
peer notification of IP address change (by exchanging three UPDATE messages with the CN).
